## Discoverability and Feature blindness

As an end-user that encounters this problem constantly, it bears repeating. 

Feature blindness has to do with how difficult it is for users to find and figure out features in software. Low discoverability leads to feature blindness, and most importantly, forgetfulness. 

Feature blindness means users may not even know a feature exists or forget about it because the user interface doesn't make it clear or visible. Out of sight, out of mind.

It can happen either because the feature is buried in complex menus where users won't find it, or because there are no visual cues (like buttons) to trigger awareness and memory of the feature.

It leads to software capabilities being unused and value left on the table. 

Common solutions involve surface-level design changes to make features more visible, findable, self-explanatory, and easier to interact with; adding reminders, configurable pop-ups, tooltips.

### PySimpleGUI

A stupidly easy solution to create GUIs for CLI apps to drastically improve discoverability and reduce feature blindness.

If every developer released a simple GUI for their CLI tool, it would enable twenty times the amount of people to benefit, the world would be a far better, more productive place.
