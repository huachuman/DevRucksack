## Discoverability and Feature blindness

As an end-user that encounters this problem constantly, it bears repeating. Feature blindness has to do with how difficult it is for users to find and figure out features in software. Low discoverability leads to feature blindness and forgetfulness. 

Feature blindness refers to when users don't know a feature exists or forget about it because the user interface doesn't make it clear or visible. Out of sight, out of mind.

It can happen either because the feature is buried in complex menus where users won't find it, or because there are no visual cues (like buttons) to trigger awareness and memory of the feature.

It leads to software capabilities being unused and value left on the table. 

Common solutions involve surface-level design changes to make features more visible, findable, self-explanatory, and easier to interact with; adding reminders, configurable pop-ups, tooltips.
